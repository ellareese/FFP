        <h1>Solutions to Marine Plastic Pollution</h1>
        <p>Addressing marine plastic pollution requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach, as the problem is 
            complex and affects both the environment and human health. It demands the active participation of individuals,
             communities, governments, and industries, all working together to reduce plastic production, consumption, 
             and waste. Effective solutions involve not only proper waste management and recycling but also public education, 
             sustainable product design, and stricter regulations on plastic use. By taking coordinated action at multiple levels, 
             society can significantly reduce the amount of plastic entering oceans and protect marine ecosystems for future generations.

        <h1>Acts you can do on your own</h1>
        <article id="solution1">
            <h2>1. Reduce Single-Use Plastics</h2>
            <p>Make a conscious effort to refuse single-use items such as plastic straws, bags, and cutlery whenever possible,
                 as these contribute significantly to marine pollution. Replace them with reusable alternatives like water bottles
                 , coffee cups, and metal or bamboo utensils, which can be used daily and last for years. Always bring your own
                  shopping bags to avoid relying on disposable plastic ones, and encourage others to do the same. Additionally,
                   try to choose products with minimal or no individual packaging, as reducing packaging waste helps prevent plastics 
                   from entering oceans and harming marine life.

        <article id="solution2">
            <h2>2. Support Local Clean-Up Programs</h2>
            <p>Volunteer for local beach or community cleanups to help remove existing litter before it reaches waterways and
                 oceans. You can also organize cleanup events with friends, family, or local groups to increase participation 
                 and make a bigger impact. These activities not only reduce plastic pollution but also raise awareness about 
                 the problem in your community. Regular cleanups help protect marine life and create cleaner, safer environments 
                 for everyone to enjoy.

            <h2>3. Practice Recycling</h2>
            <p>Practicing recycling is an effective way to reduce marine plastic pollution. By properly sorting and recycling 
                plastic waste, we prevent it from ending up in rivers, oceans, and coastal areas. Recycling also allows plastics
                 to be reused in the production of new products, reducing the demand for new plastic materials. Consistently 
                 recycling at home, work, or in the community helps protect marine life and contributes to a cleaner, healthier environment.
