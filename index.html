        <p id="background1">As early as the mid-20th century, marine plastic pollution has started to be recognized by scientists. It was observed that 
            several marine animals have begun to accidentally ingest plastics in their systems. But we aren’t sure that the practice of throwing plastic
             wastes into the ocean had just started, since scientists only discovered it because they only decided to take a look into it by the 1970s. </p>

        <p id="background2">Up until now, marine plastic pollution is still a problem and is constantly making the life of marine animals more difficult.
             Thousands if not millions of tons of wastes have been thrown into the ocean like it was nothing. Many people did not know that even the slightest
              bit of trash you throw into a river, a lake, a canal, or just any bodies of water, can have a huge contribution on plastic pollution in the ocean. 
              People think that their trash wouldn’t have a great impact on the world, but all that trash that was “insignificant” gradually increased in
               numbers and became a globally recognized problem.</p>

    <p id="para1">To address the growing problem of marine plastic pollution, the Philippines has implemented several laws focused on effective waste management and plastic 
        reduction. One key piece of legislation is the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act (RA 9003), which promotes proper waste handling through segregation, recycling,
         composting, and the use of sanitary landfills instead of open dumps. This law holds local government units (LGUs), communities, and individuals accountable for managing
          their waste responsibly and protecting the environment (Open Knowledge Repository, n.d.). Another significant law is the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Act,
           also known as Republic Act No. 11898, which requires manufacturers and producers to take full responsibility for the waste generated by their products, particularly plastic 
           packaging (A Comprehensive Guide to the Philippine EPR Law, n.d.).</p>

    <p id="para2">In addition to legislation, the Philippine government actively supports partnerships, community initiatives, and local projects aimed at improving waste collection systems and 
        promoting sustainability. These efforts contribute to building a circular economy where materials are reused and recycled rather than discarded. Programs like coastal clean-ups, 
        environmental education campaigns, and incentives for sustainable practices are also helping raise awareness and reduce the volume of plastic waste that ends up in the ocean 
        (Sur et al., 2024). These initiatives show the Philippines' ongoing commitment to combatting marine plastic pollution at both the national and grassroots levels.</p>

    <h2>What I Will Do</h2>
    <p id="para3">As a student, using the resources I have in my hand, I would like to initially spread awareness of the problem, making students from all around the world aware of what is happening.
         I would engage and participate in cleaning programs at the shorelines of bay areas and motivate others to do so as well. Since my advocacy is mainly about spreading awareness of 
         marine plastic pollution, I would educate individuals on how and where to properly throw their trash.</p>
