            <h2>How We Started</h2>
            <p id="para1">Our advocacy for marine plastic pollution started after a school-organized coastal clean-up that my group and I joined. We expected to spend a few hours picking up trash and taking photos, but what we experienced was far more impactful. The shoreline was filled with plastic waste—bottles, wrappers, straws, and even large discarded items. We were shocked to see how much garbage had accumulated, and it made us realize just how serious the problem had become. That day, we saw firsthand how plastic pollution was affecting not just the beauty of our environment, but the health of marine ecosystems as well.</p>
            <p id="para2">After that experience, our group couldn't ignore the issue. We began researching more about marine plastic pollution and discovered how deeply it affects not only marine life but also human communities. We decided to turn our concern into action by forming an advocacy group focused on raising awareness. Since then, we've participated in clean-up drives, created educational materials, and encouraged others—especially fellow students—to practice proper waste disposal and reduce plastic use. Our shared goal is to make a lasting impact by educating people and promoting a culture of responsibility and sustainability.</p>

        <p id="para3">Hi! I am Ella Reese T. Rivera, a student from Philippine Science High School. I live in a small barangay in Magsaysay, Davao del Sur, and I'm here to advocate people into thinking wisely on where they should throw their trash. I know it will be difficult, but in order to make a difference, we ourselves must take the first step towards a brighter and thriving marine community.</p>
