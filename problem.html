        <p>Marine plastic pollution is a growing global problem that affects not only the health of our oceans but
             also the well-being of people worldwide. When plastic waste enters marine environments, it harms wildlife 
             through ingestion, entanglement, and habitat disruption. Over time, these plastics break down into microplastics, 
             which accumulate in the food chain and can ultimately impact human health when contaminated seafood is consumed.
              Additionally, toxic chemicals associated with plastics can leach into the water, posing further risks to both marine
               organisms and humans. Overall, the consequences of marine plastic pollution extend far beyond the ocean, making it 
               a critical environmental and public-health issue. The following list highlights some of the major ways marine plastic 
               pollution affects both marine ecosystems and human well-being.

        <h1>Impacts on Marine Life:</h1>
        <article id="problem1.1">
            <h2>1. Ingestion/Entanglement</h2>

            <p>Marine animals often mistake plastic debris for food because many plastic items resemble the shapes, colors, or movements of their
            natural prey. When they ingest these plastics, the materials can block their digestive systems and reduce their ability to absorb
             nutrients. Over time, this can lead to severe health problems, weakness, or even death
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to ingestion, many animals become entangled in plastics drifting at the surface or throughout the water. This entang
                lement can restrict their movement and make it difficult for them to hunt, migrate, or escape predators. In severe cases, it can
                 cause injuries, infections, or drowning. These threats highlight how widespread and harmful plastic pollution is for marine life.
            </p>

        <article id="problem1.2">
            <h2>2. Destruction of habitats</h2>

            <p>
                Plastic pollution also poses a serious threat to coral reefs, which are among the most valuable and delicate ecosystems in the
                 ocean. When plastic debris settles on coral, it can block sunlight, introduce harmful bacteria, and physically damage the coral
                  structures. These stresses weaken the corals over time, making them more vulnerable to disease and bleaching.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The loss of coral reefs has far-reaching consequences because they provide essential habitat for countless marine species. Many
                 fish rely on reefs for shelter, breeding grounds, and protection from predators. When coral reefs deteriorate, the entire marine
                  food web is disrupted, endangering the species that depend on them. This decline ultimately threatens the overall balance and 
                  resilience of the marine ecosystem.
            </p>

        <article id="problem1.3">
            <h2>3. Reduced growth or organisms</h2>

            <p>
                Reduced growth in marine organisms is a significant impact of plastic pollution in the ocean. When animals ingest
                 plastics or microplastics, their digestive systems can become blocked or irritated, preventing them from absorbing the
                  nutrients they need. This lack of proper nutrition slows their growth and weakens their overall health. As a result, 
                  young organisms may struggle to reach maturity, reducing their chances of survival.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond ingestion, toxins released from plastics can also interfere with the normal development of marine species. 
                These chemicals may disrupt growth hormones or damage tissues, further limiting an organism’s ability to grow properly. Slower
                 growth rates can make species more vulnerable to predators and environmental stress. Over time, these effects 
                contribute to a decline in population stability and ecosystem resilience.

        <h1>Impacts on Human Life:</h1>
        <article id="problem2.1">
            <h2>1. Toxic Chemical Exposure</h2>

            <p>Toxic chemical exposure in organisms is a significant impact of marine plastic pollution that also threatens human life. 
                Plastics in the ocean often contain or absorb harmful chemicals, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and industrial pollutants.
                 When marine organisms ingest these contaminated plastics, the toxins accumulate in their bodies over time. This 
                 contamination becomes especially dangerous as it moves up the food chain.
            </p>

            <p>Humans are affected when they consume seafood that has absorbed these toxic substances. Long-term exposure to these chemicals
                 can lead to serious health problems, including hormonal imbalances, reproductive issues, and increased risk of certain diseases.
                  Communities that rely heavily on seafood are particularly vulnerable to these health impacts. As plastic pollution
                   continues to rise, the risks to human health grow more severe, emphasizing the need for stronger pollution control
                    and prevention efforts.

        <article id="problem2.2">
            <h2>2. Food Contamination</h2>

            <p>Food contamination in marine organisms is a major impact of plastic pollution that directly affects human life. As plastics break 
                down in the ocean, they form microplastics that are easily ingested by fish, shellfish, and other marine animals. These 
                tiny particles can carry harmful chemicals and pollutants, which then accumulate in the tissues of the organisms
                 that consume them. Over time, this contamination spreads throughout the marine food web.
            </p>

            <p>
                Humans are exposed to these contaminants when eating seafood that contains microplastics and the toxins attached to them.
                 This can pose serious health risks, including digestive issues, chemical exposure, and potential long-term effects on the 
                 immune and reproductive systems. Populations that rely on seafood as a major food source are especially at risk from this 
                 growing problem. As plastic pollution increases, the safety and quality of seafood become more concerning, highlighting the 
                 need for urgent action to reduce plastic waste.

        <article id="problem2.3">
            <h2>3. Health Issues & Concerns</h2>

            <p>
                Marine plastic pollution can lead to serious health issues in organisms, which in turn affect human life.
                 When fish, shellfish, and other seafood consume plastics or microplastics, harmful chemicals and pathogens can 
                 accumulate in their bodies. These health problems may include internal injuries, weakened immune systems, and increased 
                 susceptibility to disease. Over time, these effects compromise the safety and nutritional quality of the seafood humans consume.
            </p>

            <p>
                Humans are exposed to these risks through the food chain, particularly by eating contaminated seafood. Consuming 
                affected marine organisms can lead to chemical exposure and potential long-term health concerns, including hormonal imbalances, 
                digestive problems, and other chronic illnesses. Communities that rely heavily on seafood are particularly vulnerable to these effects. 
                This connection highlights how plastic pollution in the ocean is not only an environmental issue but also a serious public health concern.
